# A simple program that prints your text reversed

text = input("Your text: ")        # input() asks for a text 

reverse = ""                       # stores the (yet to be) reversed text

x = len(text) - 1                  # variable 'x' storing the length of the text, - 1 since the first letter's index is 0

while x >= 0:                        # while (the length of the text - 1) x is bigger or equal than 0
    reverse = reverse + text[x]      # adds the correspondent letter (text[x]) to the variable 'reverse'
    x = x - 1                        # subtracts 1 to x so the previous action can be done again, returning the other 
                                     # letters from text

    # you understand the process:
    
  # print(reverse)                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     # This will go on and on until x == 0
     
   

print(reverse)                       # prints the full text reversed!
